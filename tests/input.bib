abstract = {Light transport algorithms generate realistic images by simulating the emission and scattering of light in an artificial environment. Applications include lighting design, architecture, and computer animation, while related engineering disciplines include neutron transport and radiative heat transfer. The main challenge with these algorithms is the high complexity of the geometric, scattering, and illumination models used. In this dissertation, we develop new Monte Carlo techniques that greatly extend the range of input models for which light transport simulations are practical. We start by developing a rigorous theoretical basis for bidirectional light transport algorithms (those that combine direct and adjoint techniques). We propose a new formulation based on linear operators, such that for any physically valid input scene, the transport operators are symmetric. We also show how light transport can be formulated as an integral over a space of paths. This framework allows new sampling and integration techniques to be applied, such as the Metropolis sampling method.Our statistical contributions include multiple importance sampling, a new variance reduction technique that can greatly increase the robustness of Monte Carlo integration. It uses more than one sampling technique to evaluate an integral, and combines these samples in a way that is provably close to optimal.Finally, we propose new Monte Carlo light transport algorithms. Bidirectional path tracing uses a family of different path sampling techniques that generate some path vertices starting from a light source, and some starting from a sensor. We show that when these techniques are combined using multiple importance sampling, a large range of difficult lighting effects can be handled efficiently.The second algorithm we describe is Metropolis light transport, inspired by the Metropolis sampling method from computational physics. Paths are generated by following a random walk through path space, such that the probability density of visiting each path is proportional the contribution it makes to the ideal image. The resulting algorithm is unbiased, handles arbitrary geometry and materials, and can be orders of magnitude more efficient than previous unbiased approaches for difficult lighting problems. To our knowledge, this is the first application of the Metropolis method to transport problems of any kind.},

abstract = {We present a real-time neural radiance caching method for path-traced global illumination. Our system is designed to handle fully dynamic scenes, and makes no assumptions about the lighting, geometry, and materials. The data-driven nature of our approach sidesteps many difficulties of caching algorithms, such as locating, interpolating, and updating cache points. Since pretraining neural networks to handle novel, dynamic scenes is a formidable generalization challenge, we do away with pretraining and instead achieve generalization via adaptation, i.e. we opt for training the radiance cache while rendering. We employ self-training to provide low-noise training targets and simulate infinite-bounce transport by merely iterating few-bounce training updates. The updates and cache queries incur a mild overhead---about 2.6ms on full HD resolution---thanks to a streaming implementation of the neural network that fully exploits modern hardware. We demonstrate significant noise reduction at the cost of little induced bias, and report state-of-the-art, real-time performance on a number of challenging scenarios.},

abstract = {Despite the visual importance of hair and the attention paid to hair modeling in the
graphics research, modeling realistic hair still remains a very challenging task that
can be performed by very few artists. In this paper we present hair meshes, a new
method for modeling hair that aims to bring hair modeling as close as possible to
modeling polygonal surfaces. This new approach provides artists with direct control
of the overall shape of the hair, giving them the ability to model the exact hair
shape they desire. We use the hair mesh structure for modeling the hair volume with
topological constraints that allow us to automatically and uniquely trace the path
of individual hair strands through this volume. We also define a set of topological
operations for creating hair meshes that maintain these constraints. Furthermore,
we provide a method for hiding the volumetric structure of the hair mesh from the
end user, thus allowing artists to concentrate on manipulating the outer surface of
the hair as a polygonal surface. We explain and show examples of how hair meshes can
be used to generate individual hair strands for a wide variety of realistic hair styles.},
